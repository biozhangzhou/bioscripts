### Gemini staff - for CHEO, MH, and Muscular projects

* gemini.decompose.sh - decompose and normalize variants with vt
* gemini.vep.sh - annotate vcf file with VEP
* gemini.vep2gemini.sh - load VEP annotated vcf to the GEMINI database
* gemini.gemini2txt.sh - dump a gemini database into txt file with decompressed genotypes
* gemini.gemini2report.R  - create a nice report for import to excel from the gemini.txt dump
